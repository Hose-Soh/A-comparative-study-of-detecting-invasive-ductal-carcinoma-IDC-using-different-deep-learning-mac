Early detection of any disease is the key step towards recovery. 
Due to environmental and other reasons, breast cancer among women is increasing rapidly. And due to the shortage of expert health professionals, 
detecting at the primary stage of cancer is getting difficult. So, mortality because of cancer is also increasing. To tackle this problem, there 
is a growing need for automation of breast cancer detection. Among all the types of breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common one. 
There is a lot of techniques to detect IDC. To ensure the best outcome, comparative analysis of different techniques is essential. Using machine learning and 
deep learning technologies is a viable and more reliable option. Using image processing in case of IDC detection has various advantages like easy quantification 
of several image parameters, quantification of small but biologically significant features. In this study, we have compared the performance scores of Inception_Resnet_V2, 
MobileNet_V2, logistic Regression, PCA and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The objective is to detect IDC efficiently. For testing the model with classification algorithm, 
we have collected data from different sources and these data have been preprocessed before using in the model. We have divided our preprocessed data into 
two categories i.e., testing and training dataset. We have compared the results of algorithms using different performance metrics 
i.e., precision, recall, f1-score, etc. After comparing the performance of the algorithms, we have found out the better algorithms for predicting IDC more accurately.
